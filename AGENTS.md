You should write a code to convert English input -> Korean output.
This IME should toggle English only an Korean mode when pushing toggle key(can setup with toggle.ini, default: alt_r and hangul key)
This should support 두벌식, 세벌식, etc.
The input should be pushed to fallback input so every programs that have IME problems can get Hangul too, with this intercept-and-convert concept IME.
PLEASE CHECK HANGUL UNICODE'S GLYPH COMPOSITION METHOD.
WRITE EVERYTHING in GO, CGO DISABLED.
